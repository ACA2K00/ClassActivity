        <h1>Front-end & Back-end</h1>
        <h2>In software engineering, the terms front end and back end refer to 
            the separation of concerns between the presentation layer 
            (front end), and the data access layer (back end) of a piece of 
            software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware. 
            In the clientâ€“server model, the client is usually considered the 
            front end and the server is usually considered the back end, even 
            when some presentation work is actually done on the server itself.

            who support or maintain the product.</h2>

            website.

        <h2>A content delivery network or content distribution network (CDN) is 
            a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data
            centers. The goal is to provide high availability and high
            performance by distributing the service spatially relative to 
            end-users.</h2>
        <h1>HTML/CSS</h1>
        <h2>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
            creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets
            (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies 
            for the World Wide Web.</h2>

            describing the presentation of a document written in a markup 
            language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World 
            Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</h2>
